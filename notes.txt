INITIALIZATION:
To run the gt and generate the initial demo samples 
/bin/python /home/krahmani/HighwayEnv/sor_synthesis/highway_one_lane_simulator.py gt

Copy the sampled demo to the file that will be copied to the container
cp demos/sampled_demo.json pips/highway.json

CEGIS:
Run the ldips generated program (must be saved in ./pips/learned_policy.py) and generate repaired samples (to be stored in demos/repaired_samples.json)
/bin/python /home/krahmani/HighwayEnv/sor_synthesis/highway_one_lane_simulator.py ldips 

# Append the repaired samples (stored in demos/repaired_samples.json) to the main sample file (pips/highway.json) 
python script/copy_repaierd_samples.py

# copy the main sample file to the container and run ldips inside container, then translate the learned policy and copy it to pips/learned_policy.py
./script/run_ldips.sh
